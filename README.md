In this project we explore the relationship between the quality of 1599 red wines and 11 variables of the chemical properties of the wine. The list of attributes of the wine in the data set are as follows:
 1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
 2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
 3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)
 4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)
 5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
 6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
 7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
 8 - density (g / cm^3)
 9 - pH
 10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
 11 - alcohol (% by volume)

 At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). 
 We used exploratory data analysis techniques to find a model to predict the quality of red wine based on the attributes of the wine.
